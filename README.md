##Week3
Reflecting back on the last three weeks of leaning in general and learning to program more specifically has been eye opening for me.  I am amazed at how much information is out there, how little I know, how little I will know, and the fact that not knowing is not only something I am coming to grips with, but something that is ok.

I have always viewed not knowing as a negative.  Undertaking this journey is starting to make me see that not knowing can be plus....I don't know how to do this: let's learn how to do it, let's ask someone how they do it, let's try to do what we do know how to make happen and see if the problem becomes smaller or changes.  Not knowing doesn't become less frustrating (and I have many hours to prove that), but it does become a path that can end up leading to a more enlightened outcome.

This realization/acceptance has been one of the things I have most enjoyed.  It is the part of the journey that changes the person, not just the want to be programmer.

I would like to become more comfortable assessing the situation, laying out a plan, and then systematically working through that plan.  To this point, I feel like I have been working to achieve the end result in a ready, go, set style and I need to focus on changing that by outlining my approach before jumping into the work.  This may also be leading to me spending unproductive time trying to solve a problem.  Instead of knowing when to break away, I tend to brute force my way to a solution, which isn't effective.  This needs to change.

Regarding the actual coding, I just need to continue gaining experience by doing.  I am not going to know it all, I am only going to know a small fraction, but I can more efficient at learning what I don't know and implementing what I do know.
